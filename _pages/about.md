I am Luke Y. Lu. My legal name is Yiwen Lu but people usually call me Luke. In Chinese, my name is 卢毅文 (Simplified Chinese) or 盧毅文 (Traditional Chinese) or lú yì wén (pinyin). I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University. I am expected to graduate in 2026.

I spent a wonderful semester at Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark as an exchange student between January and June of 2025. I also studied at UCL Summer School in London, UK for a month in July 2023.

I am highly interested in research. My research interests include Computer Graphics and Artificial Intelligence.
